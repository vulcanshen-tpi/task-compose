# ⚠️ Notice: Task-Compose Has Been Merged into [digiRocket](https://github.com/TPIsoftwareOSPO/digiRocket?tab=readme-ov-file)

The task-compose project, as a standalone utility, is no longer being actively updated or maintained. All future feature development, bug fixes, and documentation updates will occur solely within the digiRocket project.

The core functionality of task-compose is now the Task Orchestration Engine at the heart of [digiRocket](https://github.com/TPIsoftwareOSPO/digiRocket?tab=readme-ov-file), built upon its robust foundation of Go and Cobra.

Task Orchestration Engine Overview
The logic of task-compose (now a core feature of [digiRocket](https://github.com/TPIsoftwareOSPO/digiRocket?tab=readme-ov-file)) is a convenient command-line utility designed to orchestrate and execute a series of commands based on a declarative YAML configuration file, similar to how container orchestrators manage services. This tool simplifies the management of complex multi-command setups, making it ideal for local development environments, testing suites, or task automation.

Using this engine, you define your tasks, their execution parameters, and their dependencies, allowing you to bring up and manage an entire set of related processes with a single command. It includes robust health check capabilities, ensuring that each task is healthy before dependent tasks are started.


# ~Task-Compose (No Longer Maintained Independently)~

`task-compose` is a convenient command-line utility built with Go and Cobra. It's designed to orchestrate and execute a series of commands based on a declarative YAML configuration file, similar to how container orchestrators manage services. This tool simplifies the management of complex multi-command setups, making it ideal for local development environments, testing suites, or task automation.

With `task-compose`, you define your tasks, their execution parameters, and their dependencies, allowing you to bring up and manage an entire set of related processes with a single command. It includes robust health check capabilities, ensuring that each task is healthy before dependent tasks are started.

### Features

- Declarative Configuration: Define all your commands and their settings in a human-readable YAML file.
- Process Orchestration: Run multiple commands concurrently or sequentially based on defined dependencies.
- Comprehensive Health Checks: Ensure your tasks are healthy before proceeding.
    - HTTP Health Checks: Verify service availability via HTTP GET requests.
      - JSON Path Validation: Extract and validate specific values from JSON HTTP responses.
    - Command Health Checks: Use custom shell commands to determine task health.
- Dependency Management: Specify task dependencies to control the startup order.
- Flexible Execution: Set base_dir, executable, args, and envs for each task.

Because we have $\color{Yellow}\large{\textbf{NOT}}$ purchased Apple and Microsoft developer accounts,
you'll currently need to manually bypass system security blocks when running the application.


## Installation

### Using Package Manager

#### Homebrew (macos/linux)

- [homebrew installation](https://brew.sh/)

```shell
# add brew tap
brew tap vulcanshen-tpi/tap
# install task-compose
brew install --cask task-compose

# macos (as "Important Note!" mention above)
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine $(which task-compose)
```

#### Scoop (windows)

- [scoop installation](https://scoop.sh/)

```shell
# add scoop tap
scoop bucket add vulcanshen-tpi https://github.com/vulcanshen-tpi/scoop-bucket.git
# install task-compose
scoop install task-compose
```

### Portable Executable

Download the compressed file that matches your system from [release](https://github.com/vulcanshen-tpi/task-compose/releases).
The filename prefix will be `task-compose-portable_`.

To run the portable executable, it must be in the same directory with the `task-compose.yaml` file.

### Basics

`task-compose.yaml`

```yaml
tasks:
  - name: echo
    executable: echo
    args:
      - hello
      - world
```

To execute tasks defined in your configuration file:

```bash
task-compose up
```

output:
```shell
task-compose|Using config file: ...(ellipsis)/task-compose.yaml
echo|hello world
echo|Completed
```

### Using Docker

```shell
docker run --rm -v ./task-compose.yaml:/app/task-compose.yaml vulcantpisoft/task-compose up
```

### Command Line Interface (CLI)

`task-compose` provides a straightforward command-line interface.

**Usage:**

```bash
task-compose [command]
```

**Available Commands:**

| Command    | Descriptions                                                |
|:-----------|:------------------------------------------------------------|
 | check      | Confirm the correctness of the YAML content format.         |
 | completion | Generate the autocompletion script for the specified shell. |
 | down       | Kill previous tasks processes.                              |

### Logging

The application's startup logs will be located in the `logs/` directory. 

Each log file will be named in the format `{task:name}-{date}.log`

### Examples

#### Example 1: Java Application Portable Launch Package

Here's an example of how you might configure `task-compose` to start .jar file using java command

**Prerequisite**
1. prepare your `myapp.jar` file.
2. (Optional) prepare portable jre. (e.g [Azul Zulu](https://www.azul.com/downloads/#zulu))
3. create a new directory, put in your `myapp.jar` and jre directory. The file structure as below:

```
new-dir/
├─ jre/
    ├─ bin/
        ├─ java(.exe)
├─ myapp.jar
├─ task-compose.yaml
├─ (Optional) task-compose-portable(.exe)
```

**Example of task-compose.yaml**

- With Portable Jre Java
    ```yaml
    tasks:
      - name: myapp
        base_dir: .
        executable: jre/bin/java(.exe) # portable jre executable
        args:
          - -jar
          - myapp.jar
    ```

- Use System Jre Java
    ```yaml
    tasks:
      - name: myapp
        base_dir: .
        executable: java # call system java command
        args:
          - -jar
          - myapp.jar
    ```

Double-click the task-compose portable executable or run `task-compose up` in your current directory's terminal.

#### Example 2: Portable Elasticsearch and Kibana Set

Here's an example of how you might configure `task-compose` to start Elasticsearch and Kibana, 
with proper health checks and dependencies:

**Prerequisite**

1. download [elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch)
2. download [kibana](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/kibana)
3. Unzip the downloaded files and place them in the same directory. The file structure as below:

files structure:
```
new-dir/
├─ elasticsearch/
├─ kibana/
├─ task-compose.yaml
├─ kibana.yml
```

**Example of kibana.yaml**

```yaml
csp.strict: false
server.ssl.enabled: false
telemetry:
  enabled: false
xpack:
  encryptedSavedObjects:
    encryptionKey: "01234567890123456789012345678901" # only for demo
```

**Example of task-compose.yaml**

```yaml
tasks:
  - name: elasticsearch
    base_dir: ./elasticsearch
    executable: bin/elasticsearch
    args:
      - -E
      - xpack.security.enabled=false
      - -E
      - xpack.security.http.ssl.enabled=false
      - -E
      - xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled=false
      - -E
      - xpack.monitoring.collection.enabled=true
    healthcheck:
      frequency:
        interval: 5s
        timeout: 10s
        retries: 5
        delay: 5s
      http:
        url: http://localhost:9200
  - name: kibana
    base_dir: ./kibana
    executable: bin/kibana
    args:
      - -c
      - kibana.yml
    healthcheck:
      frequency:
        interval: 5s
        timeout: 10s
        retries: 5
        delay: 5s
      http:
        url: http://localhost:5601/api/status
        expect:
          json:
            value: available
            jsonpath: "$.status.overall.level"
    depends_on:
      - elasticsearch
  - name: curl1
    executable: curl
    args:
      - -v
      - http://localhost:9200
    depends_on:
      - elasticsearch
  - name: curl2
    executable: curl
    args:
      - -v
      - http://localhost:5601/api/status
    depends_on:
      - kibana
```

Double-click the task-compose portable executable or run `task-compose up` in your current directory's terminal.
